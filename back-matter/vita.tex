Andrew John Castro was born in San Jose, CA.  He grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and Mexico City.  In 2012 he was awarded  Bachelors of Science from the California Polytechnic University in Pomona, CA.  During his undergraduate education, Andrew worked with Dr. Alex Small on simulating tumor growths and Dr. Antonio Auerilia on high energy physics.  In 2011, Andrew spent 3 months at the Euorpean Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) working with Dr. Tancredi Carli of the ATLAS experiment on parton distribution functions and jet physics.  
After his undergraduate studies, he entered the University of Tennessee pursuing a Ph.D in Physics.  Andrew defended his thesis in 2019.  During his time at Tennessee Andrew worked on developing trigger code for the ALICE EMCal, heavy flavor jets, light-nuclei production, hadronization, and Monte Carlo simulations.  He also contributed to the upgrade of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber to a continuous readout mode using micro pattern gaseous detectors.  
Andrew currently works for the Space Radiation Analysis Group with NASA in Houston, Texas. His work is focused on the impact that heavy-ion radiation has on biological material and solutions to shield future manned missions in space.
