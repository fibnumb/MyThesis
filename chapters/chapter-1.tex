\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

From the Vedas to the ancient Greeks, generations have described the constituents of nature in terms of indivisible `elements'.  It wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century that the ancient elements of earth, wind, fire, water, and aether were abandoned for the atomic theory of nature.  By the 1960's, what would become known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics was taking shape.  The five ancient elements were replaced by the fundamental particles: the mass carrying fermions with spin 1/2 and the force carrying bosons with spin 1 as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fundpart}

The Standard Model is the unification of the three symmetry groups, SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1), representing the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces respectively\cite{Langacker:2009my}.  In terms of scientific accomplishments, the Standard Model is one of the most tested theories of nature with an agreement between the theory and observed results up to ten digits\cite{Aoyama:2014sxa}.  Even though the Standard Model gives us a deep understanding of many natural phenomena and has a wide range of uses; from understanding the evolution of the Big Bang, the bonding of atoms and molecules, and the nature of light, to cancer treatments and nuclear security, it is fundamentally an incomplete theory of nature.  The fact that Gravity has yet to be unified into a quantum theory tells us that the Standard Model is incomplete.  High energy experiments give us some of the most extreme conditions possible to test the Standard Model and to look for phenomena outside of the theory.  Are there new symmetries and laws that manifest at high energies? Can we create dark matter or dark energy in a laboratory?  Are quarks and leptons fundamental or finite in size?  Do the four fundamental forces emerge from some yet unknown unified force?  And why is antimatter absent in the Universe?  All of these open questions are of great interest and currently form large areas of active research.

The theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD), is described by the SU(3) group and is analogous to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) with gluons being the force mediator instead of photons and quarks carrying mass.  Quarks and gluons are colloquially known as partons and are particles that interact via the strong force.  At low energies and over large length scales, partons are confined to a color neutral state and these particles must clump together into color neutral hadrons.  As two colored partons begin to separate, at some point it becomes energetically favorable to create a quark--antiquark pair out of the vacuum rather then expanding the distance between neighboring partons.  Due to confinement, quark interactions at high energy collider experiments manifest themselves as a spray of hadrons known as a `jet'.  The other main attribute of QCD is asymptotic freedom, as the interactions between partons become more energetic and the length scale decreases, the strong coupling constant becomes exceedingly small, $ \alpha_{strong} << 1$, and the partons freely interact with one another.  Due to asymptotic freedom nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition called the Quark--Gluon Plasma (QGP) at high energies and densities.

%The Large Hadron Collider(LHC) is the largest and most powerful particle collider ever built.  In 2012 it gained world wide attention for the discovery of the Higgs Boson made by the Compact Muon Solenoid(CMS) and A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS(ATLAS) experiments.  By colliding lead atoms with one another the LHC is able to achieve the temperatures and energy densities necessary to create the QGP.  However, at the LHC the QGP only has a mean lifetime of $ ~ 10^{-23}$  seconds and thus measuring the properties of this phase of matter is difficult and must be infered by the final state particles that reach the detectors. Jets are an attractive tool for measuring the properties of the QGP because they created during the earliest stages of a heavy ion collision

This thesis will present an overview of Quantum Chromodynamics in Chapter 2, with an emphasis on jet physics and heavy ion collisions.  Chapter 3 will give a brief overview of the Large Hadron Collider and the ALICE experiment, including the relevant subsystems for this jet analysis.  Chapter 4 will discuss the contribution to the upgrade of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber performed during my Ph.D. studies.  Chapter 5 will discuss the analysis methodology and corrections to the data.  Finally, Chapter 6 will present the final fully corrected results along with comparisons to theoretical calculations and previous measured observations and also act as a final discussion, outlook, and conclusion.
