\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook} \label{ch:cando}

The final portion of this thesis will put all of the results and corrections together and present the final cross sections and the comparison to different theoretical models.  In order to present the final cross-section we will discuss the systematic error analysis that will be presented along side the data.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}

Systematic uncertainties arise due to our limited knowledge of the precise operating conditions and performance of the experiment and also due to any bias in our understanding of how to fundamental model the interactions.  They systematics may therefore be broken into two components: uncertainties to the jet energy scale (JES) which shifts the momentum spectra along the x-axis and uncertainties in the jet yield which shift the spectra along the y-axis.  The systematical and statistical uncertainties presented in this analysis will be presented as errors to the yield of the spectra.  Due to the fact that the $p_{T}$ distribution follows a power law function, $dN/dp_{T} \sim p_{T}^{-5}$ uncertainties in the JES are converted to yield uncertainties by dividing each one by 5.
Due to the low statistics at the highest $p_{T}$ bins in this analysis, uncertainties in this regime my have large statistical fluctuations.  Small ,systematic variations for the input of the jet spectra will have a dramatic effect over sparsely filled bins versus bins with a low granularity.  As such it may be necessary to extrapolate the systematic from a low $p_{T}$ bin to those at the highest $p_{T}$ range.  The systematic were performed on both the MB and EMCal triggered data samples but no large variation was observed between the two, thus only the uncertainties from the MB sample are shown and are extrapolated to the triggered data.


\subsection{Systematic Uncertainty to Jet Energy Scale}

The following sections present and discuss the uncertainties cause by shifts to the JES.

\subsubsection{Tracking Efficiency Sensitivity}
Only a fraction of charged tracks generated by the hard scattering of two protons will be detected in the TPC due to finite track efficiency.  Uncertainties in the efficency of the TPC were studied and found to account for a 5\% discrepancy\cite{Abelev:2013ala}.  Reproducing this efficency was performed by randomly throwing out 5\% of the tracks from each event from the 8 TeV data samples and remeasuring the jet spectra.  All of the inputs for jet finding were maintained.

Figure \ref{fig:trkeff} shows the systematical uncertainties for R = 0.2 (top left), R = 0.3 (top right), and R = 0.4 (bottom) jets.  A 10\% systematic was applied to R = 0.2 and R = 0.3 jets while a 15\% systematic uncertainty was given to R = 0.4 jets for this analysis.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Sensativity to EMCal Clusterization Algorithm}
As previously stated, the clusterizer used in this thesis was the v2 algorithm. This algorithm was used in both the detector-level Monte Carlo and data analysis.  In order to test the sensitivity the JES has to the clusterization algorithm a different algorithm was chosen and a new spectra was generated.  The v1 algorithm was choosen and is similar to the v2 algorithm with the exception that the total size of the cluster is forced to be smaller then nine towers.  Similar to the other systematic presented we see a large anti-correlated bin-to-bin variatiaions at high-$p_{T}$ due to sparsely field binning.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Systematic Uncertainty to Jet Yield}
The following sections discuss the systematic uncertainties affecting the jet yield.

\subsubsection{Track $p_{T}$ resolution}
The momentum resolution of TPC is estimated using the covariance matrix, Figure\ref{fig:trackpcovmatrix}, generated from a Kalman filtering\cite{Fruhwirth:1987fm} pad signal on the TPC read-out region.  To estimate the systematic due to the $p_{T}$ resolution tracks are smeared 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{trackcovmatrix}
\centering
\caption{Inclusive track resolution, Min Bias 8 TeV.}
\label{fig:trackpcovmatrix}
\end{figure}

Most tracks have below 1\% momentum resolution and the tracks with $\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T} \geq$ 1\% tend to be tracks below 200 MeV tracks.  To measure the $p_{T}$ resolution I smeared each track from the Min Bias data by a Gaussian function which would alter the track $p_{T}$ by up to 1\% of its original value and remeasure the spectra.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Luminosity and Uncertainty}

The luminosity of a hadronic collider, $\mathscr{L}$, is given by the expression



\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L} = \frac{R}{\sigma}
\label{eq:xlumdef}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where R is the interaction rate and $\sigma$ is the visible cross section.  Due to the fact that we only measure events within a 10 cm window within the primary vertex region we must scale the total luminosity to that which is delievered within the primary vertex region of the ALICE experiment.  This scale factor is determined by dividing the total number of MB events to those accepted within the 10 cm window.  $N^{tot}_{MB} / N^{10 cm vertex}_{MB}$ = 1.024 from the acceptance criteria held in this analysis.
The luminosity along with its uncertainty were determined during a a special Van der Meer scan run in April of 2012\cite{ALICE-PUBLIC-2017-002}.  The total systematic uncertainty for the minimum bias (MB) trigger were obtained by measuring the visible cross section using the T0 and V0 detectors.  The MB trigger was defined as V0AND which required a hit in both the V0A and V0C.  The cross section was reported as being a combined average for MB with the V0AND as, 

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{V0} = (55.8 \pm 1.2) mb
\label{eq:xlumdef}
\end{equation}

\noindent
with a combined systematic uncertainty of 2.19\% on the visible cross section and 2.60\% on the luminosity.

\section{Inclusive Jet Spectra and Cross Section Ratios at 2.76 TeV}
Inclusive jet spectra and cross section ratios were measured in the ALICE experiment using a 2011 pp 2.76 TeV data sample\cite{MA2013319}.  Jets were reconstructed using TPC tracks and EMCal clusters with the FastJet Anti-$K_{T}$ algorithm.  Tracks with a minimum $p_{T} \geq \,$ 150 MeV and constrained to within 10 cm of the primary vertex were accepted into the jet finder.  EMCal clusters were

\section{Summary and Discussion}

Jet cross-sections are a result of QCD interactions while the ratios of the cross-sections for jets of different radii probe the hadronization process.  The essentials nature of how hadronization effects the jet cross-sections is still an open question and should be probed in future measurements at the LHC.  ALICE is in the unique position of being able to reconstruct full jets over a wide kinematic range, especially to low momentum.  
This thesis presents the first measurements of inclusive full jets at $\sqrt{s} = \,$ 8 TeV using the ALICE detector.  It also presents the procedure by which using a set of corrections and QA criteria we may obtain results comparable to pQCD Monte Carlo simulations.  The agreement between the results and Monte Carlo simulations show the jets are a well calibrated probe.  In terms of the kinematics reach the results of this thesis are in good agreement with QCD calculations down to 10 GeV/c through 100 GeV/c in $p_{T}$.  This range may be extended with better Monte Carlos in the furture and this is currently being worked on until the results are published.  With a better Monte Carlo production we could see the range extend to between 5 GeV/c to about 200 GeV/c in $p_{T}$.  The comparisons with the Monte Carlos agree well with the most tension lying with PHOJET.  However, this results are expected to improve once an improved GEANT4 Monte Carlo that models the EMCal trigger is made available.  It is striking how well both hadronization models, the Lund-String model and Clusterization model encompassed by Pythia and Herwig agree with the data.  These are fundamentally different physics phenomenology and it begs the question to why this is?   It is interesting and exciting that some of the initial questions first posed when I started my Ph.D. work remain and I am hopefully for new insights from future work in both theory and experiment.  

The results from this thesis can also be used in future heavy-ion runs to probe jet quenching as these results would serve as a baseline comparison.  The work in this thesis also presents the first jet measurements from ALICE down to 10 GeV/c, which will be important for probing energy loss in the QGP.  By measuring these very low energy jets we can probe the full energy loss mechanism for partons traversing the QGP.  Previous higher energy jet results would tend to bias to jets that traveled a very short distance through the QGP.

With the increase in energy and luminosity seen at the LHC we have moved into the era of high-precision testing of pQCD.  The work set forward by this thesis sets the stage for using jets in the future at CERN, especially after the high luminosity upgrade of the LHC is complete.  Although it dates to 2012 the 8 TeV contains some of the largest data sets available at a given energy from the LHC.  This makes it an important data set and worthy of future investigations.  I'm proud of the work presented in this body, both in terms of the data analysis and engineering aspect.  What results we will gain from the upgraded LHC and jets is only left to our imagination and to nature's mercy.
