\section{8 TeV Inclusive Jet Results from CMS and ATLAS}

CMS\cite{CMS:2013kda} and ATLAS\cite{Aaboud:2017dvo} both reported the double differential cross section for inclusive jets at 8 TeV.

\section{Inclusive Jet Spectra and Cross Section Ratios at 2.76 TeV}
Inclusive jet spectra and cross section ratios were measured in the ALICE experiment using a 2011 pp 2.76 TeV data sample\cite{MA2013319}.  Jets were reconstructed using TPC tracks and EMCal clusters with the FastJet Anti-$K_{T}$ algorithm.  Tracks with a minimum $p_{T} \geq \,$ 150 MeV and constrained to within 10 cm of the primary vertex were accepted into the jet finder.  EMCal clusters were
