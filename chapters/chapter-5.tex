\chapter{Jet Results and Discussion} \label{ch:analysis}

Beginning in March of 2012, the LHC began seven months of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = \,$ 8 TeV.  The jet cross sections and ratios of the cross sections for jets of different radii offers a unique perspective on the pQCD effects of hadronization at this new energy frontier.  Due to the expectation that no QGP is formed in a pp collision these measurements serve as a baseline for separating phenomena associated with the QGP in heavy-ion collisions.  In order to measure the jet cross section the following formula is used,

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^{2} \sigma^{jet}}{d\eta \, dp_{T}} = \frac{A_{trigger}}{\epsilon_{trigger}(p_{T})} \times C_{MC} \times \frac{1}{A(p_{T}) } \times \frac{1}{\mathscr{L}_{int}} \times \frac{dN^{jet}}{dp_{T} \, d\eta}
\label{eq:xsecdef}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where,

\begin{itemize}
  \item $A_{trigger}$ is the acceptance for EMCal triggered events and $\epsilon_{trigger}(p_{T})$ is the EMCal trigger efficiency.  These factors correct for imperfections in the electronics of the EMCal and the overall factors are equal to one in minimum bias events.
  \item $C_{MC}$ is a correction factor due to detector effects and it allows for comparisons between the ALICE experiment to other experiments or theoretical calculations.  Unfolding is used to determine this factor.
  \item $\mathscr{L}_{int}$ is the integrated luminosity during the period when the data was recorded.
  \item $A(p_{T})$ is the geometrical detector acceptance.
  \item $\frac{dN^{jet}}{dp_{T} \, d\eta}$ is the inclusive jet momentum spectra.
  
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Furthermore, it is useful to define the ratio of cross sections,

\begin{equation}
\mathscr{R}(p_{T};R_{1},R_{2}) = \frac{d^{2}\sigma(p_{T};R_{1})/d\eta \, dp_{T}}{d^{2}\sigma(p_{T};R_{2})/d\eta \, dp_{T}}
\label{eq:xsecratio}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\sigma(p_{T};R_{1})$ refers to the doubly differential cross section (Equation \ref{eq:xsecdef}) of a jet with radius $R_{1}$.  The ratio is carried out on a bin--by--bin basis per each $p_{T}$ bin.  

\section{Raw Jet Spectra}

This thesis measured inclusive jet results for radii between 0.1 and 0.5.  Furthermore, jet results for radii R = 0.2 to R = 0.4 will be presented in the body of this chapter while results from the other jet radii are still being investigated.  Figures \ref{fig:rawjetR02} \ref{fig:rawjetR03} \ref{fig:rawjetR04} show the raw (uncorrected) $p_{T}$ spectra for inclusive jets from both MB and EMCal triggered data.  It is also evident from Figures that the EMCal triggered data extends the $p_{T}$ reach of the spectra.

The next sections of this chapter will discuss the QA implemented to the data, trigger scaling, unfolding, and other corrections 

\section{8 TeV Data Quality}
ALICE is a state-of-the-art experiment with excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities as discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:alice}.  However, just like any real world experiment, it contains a number of inefficiencies and imperfections.  This means that the data collected during the 8 TeV pp collision must be examined and any inaccuracies in the data must be removed before hard physics conclusions may be reached.  Data may be compromised at both the event-level, the experiment erroneously recorded something as an event, or at the constituent-level, one of the subdetectors mismeasured a feature of a particle, and these outliers must be accounted for and removed 

\section{Event Selection}


\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=17cm]{8TeVRunefficency}

\caption{LHC state during the 8 TeV run. }
\label{fig:RunEff}
\end{figure}

During the 8 TeV data collection period approximately 180 million minimum bias events were recorded, as summarized in table \ref{tab:RunSummary}.  These events are separated into periods, which dictate the particular beam and detector configurations during the data taking.The 8 TeV data is broken into 7 periods with approximately 181 million minimum bias events recorded.  This minimum bias sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity, $\mathscr{L}_{int}$, of $8.95 \, pb^{-1}$ during this time period\cite{ALICE-PUBLIC-2017-002}.

\begin{table}[hb]
\label{tab:RunSummary}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[b]{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	Period & \# of runs & \# of Min Bias events \\ \hline
	LHC12c & 89 & $\sim \,$24 M \\ \hline
	LHC12d & 140 & $\sim \,$62 M \\ \hline
	LHC12e & 5 & $\sim \,$2 M \\ \hline
	LHC12f & 56 & $\sim \,$15 M \\ \hline
	LHC12g & 8 & $\sim \,$0.4 M \\ \hline
	LHC12h & 159 & $\sim \,$75 M \\ \hline
	LHC12i & 40 & $\sim \,$3 M \\ \hline
	Total & 497 & $\sim \,$181 M \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{2012 8 TeV data taking period.}
\end{table}

Approximately, 15\% of the data sampled is unusable due to malfunctions in TPC chambers, EMCal super modules, the electronics for the EMCal or TPC, and   

For an event to be selected into a physics analysis it must pass a number of quality control tests.  For example, the LHC must have be in a state of stable beams, cosmic rays must be excluded by only accepting tracks that originate from a vertex inside the detector, and the relevant detectors for a given analysis must be functioning as intended.  Event selection and QA is implemented via a centralized class, AliEventCuts, within the AliRoot framework.  This class contains a number of corrections including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The event has a primary vertex reconstructed.
  \item The primary vertex occurs within a 10 cm window of the primary interaction point.
  \item The vertex resolution must be below 0.25 cm.
  \item The event passes basic pile-up checks based on the V0 and T0 signals.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
A summary of the rejection reasons at the event level is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:eventqa}.

\caption{Vertex displacement from primary interaction point for accepted Min Bias events.}
\label{fig:vertrec}
\end{figure}

\noindent 
Figure \ref{fig:vertrec} shows the reconstructed vertex for the accepted Min Bias events.  We see that the vertex distribution peaks at the primary interaction point as expected.  It should also be noted that a similar set of event QA was implemented to the EMCal triggered data \textit{(not shown)} and that the results were consistant with the Min Bias data.

\subsection{EMCal Cluster Selection}
Corrections are performed on EMCal cells including; removing hot and dead towers (bad channels) based on the average occupancy and energy of the towers, calibrations to cell timing caused by the physical layout of the EMCal (such as differences in cabling length), and a energy calibration is implemented based on the $\pi^{0}$ mass.  After these corrections are applied to the towers are grouped together into clusters using the v2 algorithm.  The v2 algorithm has a minimum tower seed, $E_{seed} = \,$ 300 MeV, after which all adjacent towers with a minimum energy, $E_{cell} \geq \,$ 100 MeV, are iteratively added until a local minimum is reached.  The cluster energy is the sum of the seed and grouped neighbor tower energies.

\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:badchannel} shows the bad channel map after removing bad towers, the $\phi$ distribution is segmented into 5 parts representing the five super modules of the EMCal.  After the cells are clustered together the clusters are corrected for exotics.  This correction is performed by cutting all clusters with a $F_{cross} \geq \,$ 0.97, where

\begin{equation}
F_{cross} = 1 - \frac{ E_{cross} }{ E_{cell} },
\label{eq:Fcross}
\end{equation}

\section{EMCal Triggered Data}

In addition with the minimum bias data collected, the EMCal was used during the 8 TeV run in order to provided an enhanced data set that is preferential to hard processes.   The Level-1 trigger\cite{Bourrion:2010js} in the EMCal has a associated trigger, $\epsilon$, of 

\begin{equation}
	\epsilon = \frac{N^{Triggered}_{events}}{N^{MinBias}_{events}} \times \frac{d^{2} N_{Triggered}^{jet}}{d\eta \, dp_{T}} \Bigg/  \frac{d^{2} N_{MinBias}^{jet}}{d\eta \, dp_{T}} 
\label{eq:xsecdef}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Acceptance Correction}
Jet spectra, cross sections, and ratios of cross sections are reported over the full azimuth angle and psuedorapidity acceptance.  However, due to jets being constrained to the EMCal, a geometric factor is used to correct for the limited acceptance of the detector.  This thesis uses a maximum jet radius of 0.5 to help study the effects of wide angle radiation on jet fragmentation.  Heavy-ion use smaller jet radii, typically of 0.2, to help negate the high multiplicity background.  Due to these geometric corrections the centroid of a jet is constrained to,

\begin{equation}
|\eta_{jet}| \leq 0.7 - R, \; 1.4 + R \leq \phi_{jet} \leq 3.14 -R.
\label{eq:jetconstration}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A(p_{T}) = \frac{(1.4 - 2R) \times (1.745 - 2R)}{2 \pi}.
\label{eq:acceptance}
\end{equation}

For jets between R = 0.1 through R = 0.5 the following jet acceptance corrections are used.

\begin{table}[hb]
\label{tab:AcceptanceFactor}

\begin{tabular}[b]{|c|c|c|}

	0.3 & 0.146\\ \hline
	0.4 & 0.091\\ \hline
	0.5 & 0.048\\ \hline

\section{Unfolding}

The reconstructed jet $p_{T}$ has a number of detector effects `folded' into the measurement.  These effects included such things as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Tracking inefficiencies from the TPC and ITS.
\item Missing jet energy components from long-lived particles, such as the $K^{0}_{L}$ and neutron, that are cut by the EMCal timing requirement.
\item TPC track $p_{T}$ and EMCal cluster energy resolutions.
\item Hadronic corrections to the EMCal cluster spectrum.
\item Material loss in the detectors.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Unfolding is the method by which these detector effects are removed from the raw inclusive jet spectra and a `true' jet spectra may be obtained and compared with theoretical calculations or other experimental results.  In order to unfold a jet spectra it is necessary to generate a response matrix that simulates the described effects above, after the response matrix is generated a number of statistical approaches including, Bayesian, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), or Bin-by-Bin, may be applied to unfold the raw jet spectra.  In order to generate the response matrix we embed a Pythia generated event into a GEANT3 simulation of the ALICE detector.  Due to the fact that the performance and efficiency of the ALICE detector may change between the data taking periods each simulation is `anchored' to a given LHC, these anchors contain all the hot and dead sectors for the subdetectors, along with their calibrated performance during that specified data taking.  Two Monte Carlo data sets were produced with the MB trigger for the full 8 TeV run, the first was a Pythia generator using the Monesh-2013 tune and the second was a MB tune of the PHOjet Monte Carlo package.  Both data sets were explored for this thesis and it was decided that the final corrected spectra would be obtained via unfolding with the Pythia MC data set.  The magnitude of any one of the effects unfolding is supposed to account for is not expected to be very large, but combined may be significant, thus unfolding is an important step in this analysis.

\subsection{Response Matrix}
Given a truth-level particle jet $p_{T}$ we wish to reconstruct that jet's $p_{T}$ at the detector-level.  The particle-level pythia jets are constructed from the primary particles generated via Pythia while excluding any daughter decay particles in order to avoid double counting.  In addition the tracking efficiency in Pythia is known to deviate from nature.  This is due to Pythia under predicting the production of strange quarks.  
Constructing the response matrix in this case is calculated on a jet-by-jet basis.  The particle-level jet centroid ($\phi_{part}$,$\eta_{part}$)is matched to the detector-level jet via a constrain on the displaced distance between the two jet centroids in ($\phi$,$\eta$).  This distance was constrained to: $\Delta  R = \sqrt{(\phi_{part} - \phi_{det})^{2} + (\eta_{part} - \eta_{det})^{2}} \leq 0.25 \; $.  Once a jet is matched at the detector level to a jet generated from the particle level the response matrix is incremented by jet $p_{T}$ at both the detector and Monte Carlo levels.  The response matrix is generated with a fine binning with a width of 1 GeV per bin.

\end{array}$
\caption[Response Matrices for R = 0.2, R=0.3, and R = 0.4 jets.]{\label{fig:response}Response Matrices for R = 0.2, R=0.3, and R = 0.4 jets.}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:response} shows the response matrices for the R = 0.2 (top left), R = 0.3 (top right), and R = 0.4 (bottom) jets generated with the prescribed manner.  The response matrices display a linear relationship below 50 GeV on both axis and above ~ 100 GeV the matrices are statistics starved.  This is primarily due to the Monte Carlo Pythia and PhoJet data sets generated for the 8 TeV pp run did not model the high-$p_{T}$ triggers associated with the EMCal.  The particle jet finders configured for the response matrices allowed for jet finding down to a 100 MeV jet candidate at the particle level with no constraints on the minimum particle momentum or energy for a constituent.  The detector level jet finders were configured in the same manner as the jet finders configured for the raw jet spectra measurement.  

\subsection{Corrections to Particle Level}

Unfolding was performed using the \verb+RooUnfold+\cite{Adye:2011gm} software package.  Corrections are applied using the bin-by-bin\cite{Cowan:2002in} algorithm. 

\begin{equation}
C_{MC} \big( p_{T}^{low} : p_{T}^{high} \big) =  \frac{  \int^{p_{T}^{high}}_{p_{T}^{low}} dp_{T} \; \frac{dF^{uncorr}_{meas}}{dp_{T}} \times \frac{d^{2}N^{particle}_{MC}/d\eta \, dp_{T}}{d^{2}N^{detector}_{MC}/d\eta \, dp_{T}}  } { \int^{p_{T}^{high}}_{p_{T}^{low}} dp_{T} \; \frac{dF^{uncorr}_{meas}}{dp_{T}} }
\label{eq:binbybin}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $d^{2}N^{particle}_{MC}/dp_{T} \, d\eta$ is the PYTHIA level inclusive jet spectra, $d^{2}N^{detector}_{MC}/dp_{T} \, d\eta$ is the GEANT 3 level inclusive jet spectra, $dF^{uncorr}_{meas} / dp_{T}$ is a weight function which minimizes the dependence on the two simulation spectra shapes, finally $p_{T}^{low}$ and $p_{T}^{low}$ are the lower and upper bin limits.  Due to the limited statistics derived from the Monte Carlos available the unfolding procedure was stable only in aunfolding the truth level jet spectra for the range: $p_{T,jet} \epsilon \;$ [10 GeV, 120 GeV] for both the raw Min Bias and Emcal triggered data sets.  Due to the  the final truth value for the jet spectra will be reported in this range.



\subsection{Unfolded MB Spectra}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{RawandUnfoldedSpectraMBR03}
\centering
\caption{Unfolded jet spectra with fine binning for R = 0.3}
\label{fig:Unfoldfine}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Unfoldfine} shows an example of the output from the bin-by-bin unfodling with the fine binning for R = 0.3 jets.  It should be noted that at low-$p_{T}$ it was observed that unfolding increased the yield of the spectra while at high-$p_{T} \geq \,$ 40 GeV the yield was decreased for all jet radii in this analysis.  This is most likely due to the lack of statistics in the response matrix.  Once the bin-by-bin unfolding has been performed for the fine binned spectra the output along with the bin-by-bin correction factors ar rebinned using a variable binning between 10 GeV and 120 GeV.

\label{fig:UnfoldvarR04}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Unfolded EMCal Triggered Spectra}
The unfolding procedure is repeated again for the EMCal triggered jet spectra.  The response matrix from the Min Bias sample is used for the bin-by-bin unfolding and performed using a fine binning.  The detector level and particle level jets are configured in the same manner as above and the output from the unfolded triggered specta are reported after rebinning to a variable size over the same kinematic range as the Min Bias sample.

\centering
\caption{Unfolded EMCal triggered R = 0.4 jet spectra with corrections factors using a variable binning.}
\label{fig:UnfoldvarR04EGA}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Due to the limitations on the response matrix the bin-by-bin unfolding of the EMCal triggered data was only stable up to 120 GeV.  It should be noted that the hump in the EMCal jet spectra is due to the firing threshold of the trigger.  The unfolded Emcal jet spectra was used to estimate the ratio the the jet yields between the Min Bias and triggered data samples, from this point the trigger scaling was calculated.  Due to the lack of a trigger modeled with the 8 TeV Monte Carlo productions the inability to extend the kinematic range of the jet spectras beyond 120 GeV presents a missed oppurtunity in terms of the recorded data from the 8 TeV runs.  In order to address this issue a new Monte Carlo production will need to be requested from the ALICE collaboration.

\subsection{Jet Reconstruction and Matching Efficiency}
In order to quantify the inefficiencies due to unfolding along with inefficencies in the ALICE experiment in reconstructing jets we quantify the jet reconstruction efficiency, $\epsilon_{reco} (p_{T, jet})$, and the jet matching efficiency, $\epsilon_{match} (p_{T, jet})$.

\begin{equation}
 \epsilon_{reco} (p_{T, jet}) = \frac{N_{reco}(p_{T, jet}) }{N_{Truth} (p_{T, jet})}
\label{eq:jetrecoeff}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \epsilon_{match} (p_{T, jet}) = \frac{N_{match}(p_{T, jet}) }{N_{Truth}(p_{T, jet})}
\label{eq:jetmatchoeff}
\end{equation}

\noindent 
where $N_{reco} (p_{T, jet})$ is the reconstructed jet yield at the detector level per $p_{T}$ bin, $N_{match}(p_{T, jet})$ is the reconstructed jet at the detector level that was matched to a particle level jet per $p_{T}$ bin, and $N_{truth} (p_{T, jet})$ is the truth-level jet yield from the Pythia embedded event per $p_{T}$ bin.  These quantities 

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}

Systematic uncertainties arise due to our limited knowledge of the precise operating conditions and performance of the experiment and also due to any bias in our understanding of how to fundamental model the interactions.  They systematics may therefore be broken into two components: uncertainties to the jet energy scale (JES) which shifts the momentum spectra along the x-axis and uncertainties in the jet yield which shift the spectra along the y-axis.  The systematical and statistical uncertainties presented in this analysis will be presented as errors to the yield of the spectra.  Due to the fact that the $p_{T}$ distribution follows a power law function, $dN/dp_{T} \sim p_{T}^{-5}$ uncertainties in the JES are converted to yield uncertainties by dividing each one by 5.
Due to the low statistics at the highest $p_{T}$ bins in this analysis, uncertainties in this regime my have large statistical fluctuations.  Small ,systematic variations for the input of the jet spectra will have a dramatic effect over sparsely filled bins versus bins with a low granularity.  As such it may be necessary to extrapolate the systematic from a low $p_{T}$ bin to those at the highsest $p_{T}$ range.  The systematics were performed on both the MB and EMCal triggered data samples but no large variation was observed between the two, thus only the uncertainties from the MB sample are shown and are extrapolated to the triggered data.


\subsection{Systematic Uncertainty to Jet Energy Scale}

\subsubsection{Tracking Efficiency}
Corrections for the tracking efficiency were performed by randomly throwing out 5\% of the tracks from each event from the 8 TeV data samples and reperforming jet on the altered data.  All of the inputs for jet finding were maintained.

\subsubsection{Luminosity Uncertainty}

The luminosity of a hadronic collider, $\mathscr{L}$, is given by the expression



\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L} = \frac{R}{\sigma}
\label{eq:xlumdef}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where R is the interaction rate and $\sigma$ is the visible cross section.  Due to the fact that we only measure events within a 10 cm window within the primary vertex region we must scale the total luminosity to that which is delievered within the primary vertex region of the ALICE experiment.  This scale factor is determined by dividing the total number of MB events to those accepted within the 10 cm window.  $N^{tot}_{MB} / N^{10 cm vertex}_{MB}$ = 1.024 from the acceptance criteria held in this analysis.
The luminosity along with its uncertainty were determined during a a special Van der Meer scan run in April of 2012\cite{ALICE-PUBLIC-2017-002}.  The total systematic uncertainty for the minimum bias (MB) trigger were obtained by measuring the visible cross section using the T0 and V0 detectors.  The MB trigger was defined as V0AND which required a hit in both tjhe V0A and V0C.  The cross section was reported as being a combined average for MB with the V0AND as, 

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{V0} = (55.8 \pm 1.2) mb
\label{eq:xlumdef}
\end{equation}

\noindent
with a combined systematic uncertainty of 2.19\% on the visible cross section and 2.60\% on the luminosity.
