    abstract = { The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was first suggested (in a documented way) in 1983 (S. Myers and W. Schnell, Preliminary performance estimates for a LEP proton collider, LEP Note 440, April 1983) as a possible future hadron collider to be installed in the 27 km "LEP" tunnel. More than 30 years later the collider has been operated successfully with beam for three years with spectacular performance and has discovered the long-sought-after Higgs boson. The LHC is the world's largest and most energetic particle collider. It took many years to plan and build this large complex machine which promises exciting, new physics results for many years to come. I describe the LHC design objectives, review some of the more relevant beam effects, define the major accelerator components and parameters, and finally give an overview of the commissioning and operational performance since the initial turn on of the collider. The latter will include the major accident which took place in September 2008 and the subsequent repair and redesign of the faulty components. The first attempt to circulate beam in the LHC in September 2008 were initially very successful. However, after only nine days of preliminary beam commissioning, on 19 September 2008, disaster struck: the last octant was being ramped up in preparation for high energy operation when a magnet interconnect failed and the enormous energy stored in the superconducting magnets was released in an uncontrolled way and damaged around 600 m of the LHC installed equipment. The next 14 months were crucial for the machine. A crash programme for the repair of the damaged sector was initiated as well as in depth studies to understand the cause of the failure and make design changes which would ensure that such an accident could never reoccur in the future. In this paper, the story of the four years of the intensive activity since the accident is described starting with the repair of the damaged area and followed by the three very successful years of beam operation. }

The ITS covers the pseudorapidity range |η|≤ 0.9 and the distance from the nominal beam line ranges from 3.9cm for the innermost layer up to 43cm for the outermost. The two innermost layers are made of Silicon Pixel Detectors (SPD), the two central layers of Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) and the two outermost layers of double sided Silicon Strip Detectors (SSD). The ITS has the main purposes of providing both primary and secondary vertices reconstruction and of improving the ALICE barrel tracking capabilities in the vicinity of the interaction point. Furthermore, as a standalone tracker, the ITS recovers particles which do not reach or are missed by the external barrel detector, due to acceptance limitations and momentum cutoff. After a short summary on the status of spatial alignment and detector calibration, this paper will focus on the ITS performances with with proton and lead beams in 2010 for what concerns vertexing and tracking."

We describe the detector and the calibration procedures necessary to guarantee an optimal data quality. We report on the performance, in particular of tracking and particle identiﬁcation, and on readout speed. Finally, we summarize the challenges in the design and the experience in operating the Time Projection Chamber under the extreme conditions of heavy-ion collisions at the LHC."

The EMCAL detector is a large area electromagnetic calorimeter. ALICE's capability to perform jet reconstruction is greatly improved by measuring the neutral energy component of jets including photons and neutral pions. The calorimeter produces also a fast, high-p T trigger providing an enhancement in high-p T events, participates in the High Level Trigger (HLT), performing online reconstruction at the full data rates and generates trigger information based on reconstructed events. The performance of prototypes has been studied in test beam measurements at FNAL and CERN and are shown. Four EMCAL super-modules have been installed at CERN and are operational. First results from data taking are presented. Moreover, an extension of EMCAL for jet-jet and γ -jet physics will be discussed.}

These events appear to be very interesting to probe the strongly interacting matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions and the eventual Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) state. Indeed, they may give information on the degree of medium opacity which induces the jet-quenching phenomenon: measuring the energy of the γ and comparing it to that of the associated jet may provide a unique way to quantify the jet energy loss in the dense matter. The interest of γ-jet studies in the framework of the quark gluon plasma physics will be discussed. A particular highlight will be stressed on the EMCal calorimeter. The detection of the γ-jet events will be then presented using this new ALICE detector.}

  abstract={ALICE at the LHC, collecting data in Pb-Pb, p-Pb and pp collisions, aims for the characterisation of the strongly interacting matter at unprecedented energy densities. While the first running period until 2018 can provide detailed description of the global and bulk phenomena and a first set of intriguing results on rare probes of heavy-ion collisions, many important questions involving rare processes cannot be addressed in details with the current experimental setup. In this talk, we give an overview of the ALICE Upgrade program focusing on the physics prospects related to heavy-quarks, quarkonia, low-mass dileptons, jets and exotica searches achievable in high luminosity Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. We also discuss the technological challenges and choices of the detector upgrades to be installed during the LHC Long Shutdown 2.}

  abstract={As a result of the LHC injectors upgrade after the Long Shutdown (2019-2020), the expected Pb-Pb luminosity and collision rate during the so called Runs 3 and 4 will considerably exceed the design parameters for several of the key ALICE detectors systems including the forward trigger detectors. Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) will be the primary forward trigger, luminosity, and collision time measurement detector. It will also determine multiplicity, centrality, and reaction plane of heavy ion collisions. FIT is expected to match and even exceed the functionality and performance currently secured by three ALICE sub-detectors: the time zero detector (T0), the VZERO system (V0), and the Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD). FIT will consist of two arrays of Cherenkov radiators with MCP-PMT sensors and of a single, large-size scintillator ring. Because of the presence of the muon spectrometer, the placement of the FIT arrays will be asymmetric: ∼800 mm from the interaction point (IP) on the absorber side and ∼3200 mm from IP on the opposite side. The ongoing beam tests and Monte Carlo studies verify the physics performance and refine the geometry of the FIT arrays. The presentation gives a short description of FIT, triggers and readout requirement for the ALICE Upgrade, a summary of the performance, and the outcome of the simulations and beam tests.}

  abstract={In this paper, a single-mask substrate transfer process for the fabrication of high-aspect-ratio (HAR) suspended structures is presented. The HAR silicon structures are fabricated using a deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) technique and then transferred to a glass wafer using silicon/thin film/glass anodic bonding and silicon thinning techniques. The HAR structures are released using self-aligned wet etching of the glass. Two key processes are discussed. One is the silicon/thin film/glass anodic bonding, with special emphasis on the effect of the bonding material on the bonding shear strength. The other is the silicon backside thinning via aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). A lateral RF MEMS switch has been fabricated and demonstrates low loss up to 25 GHz. This substrate transfer process has the advantages of high-aspect ratio, low loss and high flexibility.}

	Abstract = {At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at √ s = 7 TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb -1 . The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events. For analyses requiring higher purity, a misidentification probability of only 1.5% has been achieved, for a 70% b-jet tagging efficiency.},

@article{Back200528,
	Abstract = {This paper describes the conclusions that can be drawn from the data taken thus far with the \{PHOBOS\} detector at RHIC. In the most central Au + Au collisions at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high energy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of freedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system are found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of particle production at \{RHIC\} energies are shown to follow a number of simple scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing Au + Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of participants at higher p T ( ∼ 4   GeV / c ) is very similar to that at low transverse momentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and elliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of pseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei, a property we describe as ``extended longitudinal scaling''. Finally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were found to factorize to a surprising degree. },

@article{Adams2005102,
	Abstract = {We review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus--nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on results from the \{STAR\} experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au + Au collisions at \{RHIC\} produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice \{QCD\} for establishment of a quark--gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating \{QGP\} formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark--gluon matter has been produced at RHIC. },

	Abstract = {In a hydrodynamic model, we have analysed the direct photon data obtained by the WA98 collaboration in 158 A GeV Pb + Pb collisions. The transverse expansion of the system has been taken into account. Two scenarios have been considered: (i) the formation of quark--gluon plasma and (ii) the formation of hot hadronic gas. Both scenarios describe the data equally well. However, the hadronic gas scenario requires a very high initial temperature (~300 MeV) and it is difficult to conceive of the existence of hadron gas at that high temperature. If, initially, the hadronic fluid possesses small radial velocity (0.2--0.3 c), the data are well explained in the hadronic gas scenario, with reasonable initial temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The \{ALICE\} Collaboration at the \{LHC\} reports measurement of the inclusive production cross section of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of beauty hadrons with rapidity | y | &lt; 0.8 and transverse momentum 1 &lt; p T &lt; 10 GeV / c , in pp collisions at s = 2.76 TeV . Electrons not originating from semi-electronic decay of beauty hadrons are suppressed using the impact parameter of the corresponding tracks. The production cross section of beauty decay electrons is compared to the result obtained with an alternative method which uses the distribution of the azimuthal angle between heavy-flavour decay electrons and charged hadrons. Perturbative \{QCD\} predictions agree with the measured cross section within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. The integrated visible cross section, σ b → e = 3.47 $\pm$ 0.40 ( stat ) − 1.33 + 1.12 ( sys ) $\pm$ 0.07 ( norm ) μb , was extrapolated to full phase space using Fixed Order plus Next-to-Leading Log (FONLL) calculations to obtain the total b b ¯ production cross section, σ b b ¯ = 130 $\pm$ 15.1 ( stat ) − 49.8 + 42.1 ( sys ) − 3.1 + 3.4 ( extr ) $\pm$ 2.5 ( norm ) $\pm$ 4.4 ( \{BR\} ) μb . },

@article{WoodsSaxon,
	Abstract = {A modified Woods--Saxon (MWS) potential is proposed for describing nucleus-nucleus interaction based on the Skyrme energy-density functional approach. Fusion barriers of a large number of fusion reactions from light to heavy systems can be systematically described well with this potential. The suitable incident energies for the fusion reactions leading to superheavy nuclei are also explored. It seems to us that the MWS potential can provide the suitable incident energies for fusion reactions for producing super-heavy nuclei.},
